## Distributed Relay Chat Server
This project implements a distributed chat server in Python that enables real time messaging across a network of clients and servers using TCP sockets.  
  
In this project, a relay based chat network is implemented where multiple servers can interconnect to form a distributed system, allowing clients connected to any server to communicate with clients on any other server in the network
